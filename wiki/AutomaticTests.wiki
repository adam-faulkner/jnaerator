#summary Description of the automatic tests performed on JNAerator

= Overview =

There are many things to test in JNAerator, and the current test coverage is rather low.

TODO
 * test that some example code that would link to jnaerated interfaces compiles

= DOM Elements tests =

There are tests that ensure that all subclasses of the Element class behave as Java beans and respect the hierarchy : 
 * any child element added to a parent element must appear in one of the properties of its parent (or must be one of the items in a list or set property), and the child's parentElement property must point to the parent.
 * any element can be instantiated with a default constructor
 * get(set) of any property should return an object that is equal to the one provided (equal with the Object.equals method)
 * getters of lists should be unmodifiable (there are addXXX methods to add items to list or set properties)
 * any element of any type added to any other element of any type as some compatible property must be visited by a Scanner.

= Parsing Tests = 

I ensure that a few dozen expressions are parsed without error and that they are serialized back exactly as they were read.

I also ensure some expressions are not parsed properly (e.g. {{{ int[4] var; }}}.

Some expressions are not yet serialized back properly and I only test that their parsing yields no error.
