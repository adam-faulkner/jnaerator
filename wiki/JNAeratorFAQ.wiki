= How to use `MyLib.dll` with `MyLibHeader.h` header from Java ? =

{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar MyLib.dll MyLibHeader.h
}}}
will produce {{{ MyLib.jar }}}

= How to use `MyLib.dll` without headers from Java ? =

This is experimental and has big limitations, but simple cases should work :
{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar MyLib.dll MyLibHeader.h -scanSymbols
}}}
will produce {{{ MyLib.jar }}}

= How to use the output of `MySolution.sln` from Java ? =

First make sure you compiled your solution in Release for both Win32 and Win64 targets, if needed.
{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar MyLibHeader.sln
}}}
will produce {{{ MySolution.jar }}}

= How to include self-extracting libraries binaries in JAR outputs ? = 

This is already done by default, provided that you add the paths to all needed libraries binaries to JNAerator's command line.

= How to use MacOS X frameworks from Java ? = 

For most commonly used public frameworks, you should simply download Rococoa and use it alone.

If you need frameworks not covered by Rococoa, wish to use private headers and / or frameworks or ObjectiveC libraries for which no headers are available, then you should use JNAerator :

{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar -framework Framework1 -framework Framework2 lib1.dylib lib2.dylib...
}}}

= What command-line options and environment variables are available ? = 

There are quite a few of them : [CommandLineOptionsAndEnvironmentVariables]

= Is there a mailing list where I can ask for some help ? =

For now, [https://jna.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=users JNA's users mailing list] is THE place to be.

= JNAerator stalls when fed with large headers = 

This appears to be a bug coming from its ANTLR parser, which does not react well to low-memory conditions.

You can solve this by increasing the maximum memory allocated to the JVM :
{{{
java -Xmx500m -jar jnaerator.jar your-arguments-here
}}}

= I found a bug in JNAerator. Where shall I file it ? = 

The [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues Issues] section is here for that.
