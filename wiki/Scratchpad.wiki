#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

JNAerator builds bridges between native libraries and Java.

JNAerator can parse C, C++ and ObjectiveC headers, BridgeSupport files, Visual Studio solutions and can even reverse-engineer headers out of a DLL.

It JNAerates self-contained JARs with compiled Java proxy definitions and needed runtime + auto-extractible binaries, ready to use for Java development.

The JNAeration process is highly automated : choose your headers / your DLL / your solution, run JNAerator and boom : you're done.

= Limitations =

C++ runtime support is limited to functions, static methods and globals (no instance methods nor object creation possible yet).

Also, JNAerator's parser may not parse well everything you may want to throw at it. Please file bug reports in the Issues section if you manage to isolate parsing bugs.
