#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

*JNAerator* builds *bridges between native libraries and Java*.

It parses *C*, *C++* and *ObjectiveC* headers, *BridgeSupport* files, *Visual Studio* solutions and can even extract and *reverse-engineer DLL exported symbols*.

JNAerator *creates self-contained JARs* with compiled Java proxy definitions and needed runtime + auto-extractible binaries, *ready to use* for Java development.

Everything is *highly automated* : typically you'll just need to pick some headers / DLLs / solutions, but you can also configure many aspects of the process.

= Limitations =

C++ runtime support is limited to functions, static methods and globals (no instance methods nor object creation possible yet).

Symbols extraction from shared libraries is limited to Windows DLLs for now, and is only available when run from Windows.

Also, JNAerator's parser may not parse well everything you may want to throw at it. Please file bug reports in the Issues section if you manage to isolate parsing bugs.
