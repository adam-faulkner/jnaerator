JNAerator's parser and transformation code is Copyright [http://ochafik.free.fr/ Olivier Chafik] (c) 2008-2009 (everything that lies in the com.ochafik.*, com.bridj.* packages]).

JNAerator ships with the following libraries :
 * [http://bridj.googlecode.com/ BridJ] (BSD license, Copyright (c) 2009, Olivier Chafik) : A new C/C++ interop library akin to JNA
 * [http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/ Anarres JCPP] (Apache 2.0 license, Copyright (c) 2007-2008, Shevek) : [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/source/browse/trunk/#trunk/libraries/anarres patched with a few fixes and enhancements (all contributed back)]
 * [http://jna.dev.java.net/ Java Native Access (JNA)] (LGPL license, Copyright (c) 2006-2009 Todd Fast, Timothy Wall, Wayne Meissner & others) : [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/source/list?path=/trunk/libraries/jna/src/com/sun/jna/Structure.java patched] with support for bit fields in structs
 * [https://rococoa.dev.java.net/ Rococoa] (LGPL license, Copyright Duncan McGregor and others, see below) : [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/rococoa-jnaerator.zip slightly modified to make NSObject an abstract class]
 * [http://www.antlr.org/ ANTLR's runtime] (BSD license, Copyright (c) 2003-2008, Terence Parr) : unmodified
 * [http://jedit.org/ jEdit] 2.2.1 syntax highlighting package ([http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/Documentation/README.txt released to the public domain], Copyright 1998-1999 Slava Pestov, Artur Biesiadowski, Clancy Malcolm, Jonathan Revusky, Juha Lindfors and Mike Dillon)
 * [http://jalico.googlecode.com/ JaLiCo], also written by Olivier Chafik (Apache 2.0 license).

 * [http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.5RC4-200906051444/index.php#JDTCORE Eclipse standalone compiler 3.5]. It is released under the [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html Eclipse Public License 1.0] and its source is available on Eclipse's website.

Please read the following sections for licensing details related to the aforementioned libraries.

Note that in accordance with the LGPL library, you should be able to use another version of JNA (possibly modified or upgraded) instead of that shipping with JNAerator. Simply make sure its JAR appears first in the classpath, or replace the com.sun.jna.`*` packages inside JNAerator.jar by the new ones.
