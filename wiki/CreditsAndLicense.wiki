JNAerator's parser and transformation code is Copyright [http://ochafik.free.fr/ Olivier Chafik] (c) 2008-2009 (everything that lies in the com.ochafik.* packages).

JNAerator ships with the following libraries :
 * [http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/ Anarres JCPP] (Apache 2.0 license) : slightly patched
 * [http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/ GNU Trove] (_mostly_ LGPL license, details below) : unmodified
 * [http://www.antlr.org/ ANTLR's runtime] (BSD license) : unmodified

JNAerator requires and "links to" the following libraries, but doesn't ship with them for now :
 * [http://jna.dev.java.net/ Java Native Access (JNA)] (LGPL license) : unmodified

Please read the following sections for licensing details related to the aforementioned libraries.

Note that in accordance with the LGPL library, you should be able to use another version of Trove (resp. JNA) instead of that shipping with JNAerator by simply making sure its JAR appears first in the classpath, or by removing/replacing the gnu.trove.* (respectively com.sun.jna.*) packages inside JNAerator.jar.
