JNAerator's parser and transformation code is Copyright [http://ochafik.free.fr/ Olivier Chafik] (c) 2008-2009 (everything that lies in the com.ochafik.`*` packages).

JNAerator ships with the following libraries :
 * [http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/ Anarres JCPP] (Apache 2.0 license) : slightly patched
 * [http://jna.dev.java.net/ Java Native Access (JNA)] (LGPL license) : unmodified
 * [http://www.antlr.org/ ANTLR's runtime] (BSD license) : unmodified
 * [http://jalico.google.com/ JaLiCo], also written by Olivier Chafik.

Please read the following sections for licensing details related to the aforementioned libraries.

Note that in accordance with the LGPL library, you should be able to use another version of Trove (resp. JNA) instead of that shipping with JNAerator by simply making sure its JAR appears first in the classpath, or by removing/replacing the gnu.trove.`*` (respectively com.sun.jna.`*`) packages inside JNAerator.jar.
