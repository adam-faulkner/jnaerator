#summary Plans for JNAerator

= Enhancements =

  # create Pointer subclasses for unknown pointer references
  # automated tests for Objective-C (long time no try !)
  # enhance test coverage of JNAerator with the new JNAerationTests infrastructure
  # prefer simple names for structs and enums (S typedef instead of _S tag)
  # [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=5 Translate macros and inline functions to Java]
  # refactor entirely the convertTypeToJNA method to something much cleaner (scanner ?)
  # rework globals entirely : Lib.get(), Lib.set(int) when possible
  # parse {{{ typedef unsigned U; register U int i; }}} : either parse a soup of words and disambiguate in a separate pass or renounce to multithreaded parsing and lookup typedefs from inside the parser
 
= Bugfixes = 

  # fix the compiler's classpath in in JNAeratorStudio + Web Start
  # fix the line-numbering in comments
